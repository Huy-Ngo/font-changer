# Font customizer
Some docs or sites have their font size too small, or color too hideous to see, which constraints my eyes. I made this chrome extension to solve that. This is mainly for personal uses, but if you like it, feel free to download.

Yes, I know there are tons of other extensions out there, but I find them not fitting my uses, so I write one myself.

# Usage
1. Download this
2. Go to chrome://extensions and click on "load unpacked"
3. Select the folder of this extension
4. Click the 3 buttons to enlarge font, switch to night mode or day mode. Refresh page to restore default styling.

I do not ensure that all of these styling would fit any page.
